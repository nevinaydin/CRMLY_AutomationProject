## Setting up Hub and Node
Creating Hub and Node using virtual machine can be heavy, expensive and error prone. 

It's relatively easy to setup Hub and Node using Docker container.
- Docker is lightweight **just enough operating system** for specific need.
- It can be created from **template** known as `Docker image`.
- Multiple container can work together to serve like mutiple VMs. 
- It can be easily managed by a docker fucntionality called `docker-compose`
  - It's use a file to control what need to happen 
  - We want to create a **hub**
  - We want to create multiple **nodes**
  - We want to register these nodes to hub so it can manage it
  - We will do all these using **pre-written compose file**

## Creating new AWS EC2 Instance 
- We will create another EC2 Machine that have Linux operating system
  - We will use **script** to install tools needed:
  - Install docker inside the Linux machine
  - Install other tools needed for running container
  - Use **pre-written compose file** to setup hub and node
  - Navigate to the Hub URL to see the nodes and capability
  - Go to IntelliJ and **update the IP address for Hub**
  - Run the code and observe !!!!


  #!/bin/bash
sudo yum update -y &&  
sudo amazon-linux-extras install -y docker && 
sudo service docker start && 
sudo usermod -a -G docker ec2-user && 
sudo chkconfig docker on && 
sudo yum install -y git && 
sudo curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose && 
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose && 
docker-compose version && 
sudo curl -L https://cybertek-shared.s3.amazonaws.com/docker-compose.yml -o /home/ec2-user/docker-compose.yml && 
sudo reboot


Once your ec2 instance is initialized and fully launched

* Conntect to the machine using the connect button 
* You will be inside the Command line interface of Linux machine of yours 
* type command ls it will show one file exists that that location 
* the file docker-compose.yml has everything we need to spin up hub and nodes for selenium
* type this command 
    docker-compose up -d
 
* It will download and run all necessary part of setting up everything
* Once it's done navigate to URL below
